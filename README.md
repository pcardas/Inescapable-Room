# Rendeiro-Unescapable-Room

// Project Description
Our first group project which took part in our 4th week at <Academia de CÃ³digo_> #76 Bootcamp @ Porto.
We were challenged to create a game project applying the technologies we had learned the previous weeks. 
Deadline for project deployment: 10 nights!

// The Idea
In group, we did a brainstorming in order to get the best idea for our project. The game has a character, which is a thief, that needs to catch the maximum frames that he possibly can. If the plans don't go well and he catch a handcuff, he goes to the prison and the game ends. 

// Development
Our work strategy was based in daily meetings, which consisted in getting an update of how the tasks were being done. We started defining the project structure. After that there was time to implement the game logic and features such as: movement, object collision, graphic elements and a user interface.

// Techs && Methodologies
Java 7, OOP, SimpleGFX Library, Intellij IDEA, Apache Ant, Git
